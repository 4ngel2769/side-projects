# ðŸ”¨ Side Projects Hub

Welcome to my playground of handy scripts and utilities!
This repository is a collection of my side-projects, tools, and more that I build for solving real-world problems, experimenting with APIs, and learning new things. Browse below for a quick tour, or pick a project and try it out!

## ðŸš€ Projects

### [YouTube Transcript Search Tool (`ytt-search`)](scripts/ytt-search/README.md)
> **What it does:**
Scan YouTube channels, single videos, or a batch of links and search transcripts for your keywords or phrases.
Highlights matches in context, prints jump-to links with timestamps, and shows a slick progress bar!

> **Why:**
I made this tool out of a need to find that one thing someone said in that one 2 hour podcast that I can't find.

### [Recursive Web Directory Downloader (`rwdl`)](scripts/rwdl/README.md)
> **What it does:**
Recursively crawl Apache-style web directories and download files matching your extensions (e.g. `.iso`, `.torrent`, `.exe`).
Keeps folder structure intact, skips duplicates, and can resume where it left off.

> **Why:**
I wrote this script because I needed a way to mirror all the .torrent files from the ParrotSec repo into the same versioned folder structure as the original site.
